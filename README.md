Welcome to the MERN Stack URL Shortener project! This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter and more manageable links. It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This README file will guide you through the setup and usage of the application.
